MochiKit Makes JavaScript Suck Less

MochiKit is a highly documented and well tested, suite of JavaScript libraries that will help you get shit done, fast. We took all the good ideas we could find from our Python, Objective-C, etc. experience and adapted it to the crazy world of JavaScript.

See http://mochi.github.com/mochikit/about.html and http://mochi.github.io/mochikit/doc/html/MochiKit/index.html for documentation.
