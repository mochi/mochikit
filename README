# MochiKit

## Making JavaScript better and easier.

MochiKit is a highly documented, maintained and well-tested library that consists of "submodules" which all provide the shit that goes into MochiKit. The end result is a modular, customizable library that is great for the web and the server. I have refactored this library to use es6 modules, which are great for being modular, especially with Rollup's tree-shaking feature, meaning only the required modules are bundled, meaning a faster client-side experience.

You can see how MochiKit works by checking out our suite of demos, at http://mochi.github.io/mochikit/demos.html.
See http://mochi.github.com/mochikit/about.html for more information about MochiKit, and http://mochi.github.io/mochikit/doc/html/MochiKit/index.html for documentation.
