MochiKit.Signal - Simple universal event handling


Synopsis
========

Signal for DOM events::

    // DOM events are also signals. Connect freely! The functions will be
    // called with the custom event as a parameter.

    // calls myClicked.apply(getElement('myID'), event)
    connect('myID', 'onclick', myClicked);

    // calls wasClicked.apply(myObject, event)
    connect('myID', 'onclick', myObject, wasClicked);

    // calls myObject.wasClicked(event)
    connect('myID', 'onclick', myObject, 'wasClicked');    

    // the event is normalized, no more e = e || window.event!
    myObject.wasClicked = function(e) {
        var crossBrowserCoordinates = e.mouse().page;
        // e.mouse().page is a MochiKit.DOM.Coordinates object
    }


Signal for non-DOM events::

    // otherObject.gotFlash() will be called when 'flash' signalled.
    connect(myObject, 'flash', otherObject, 'gotFlash');

    // gotBang.apply(otherObject) will be called when 'bang' signalled.
    // You can access otherObject from within gotBang as 'this'.
    connect(myObject, 'bang', otherObject, gotBang);

    // myFunc.apply(myObject) will be called when 'flash' signalled.
    // You can access myObject from within myFunc as 'this'.
    var ident = connect(myObject, 'flash', myFunc);

    // You may disconnect with the return value from connect
    disconnect(ident);

    // Signal can take parameters. These will be passed along to the connected
    // functions.
    signal(myObject, 'flash');
    signal(myObject, 'bang', 'BANG!');


Description
===========

Event handling was never so easy!

This module takes care of all the hard work |---| figuring out which event
model to use, trying to retrieve the event object, and handling your own
internal events, as well as cleanup when the page is unloaded to clean up IE's
nasty memory leakage.

This event system is largely based on Qt's signal/slot system. Read more on
how that is handled and also how it is used in model/view programming at:
http://doc.trolltech.com/


Dependencies
============

- :mochiref:`MochiKit.Base`
- :mochiref:`MochiKit.DOM`


Overview
========

Using Signal for DOM Events
---------------------------

When using MochiKit.Signal, do not use the browser's native event API. That
means, no ``onclick="blah"``, no ``elem.addEventListener(...)``, and certainly
no ``elem.attachEvent(...)``. This also means that
:mochiref:`MochiKit.DOM.addToCallStack` and
:mochiref:`MochiKit.DOM.addLoadEvent` should not be used in combination with
this module.

Signals for DOM objects are named with the ``'on'`` prefix, e.g.:
``'onclick'``, ``'onkeyup'``, etc.

When the signal fires, your slot will be called with one parameter, the custom
event object.


Custom Event Objects for DOM events
-----------------------------------

Signals triggered by DOM events are called with a custom event object as a
parameter. The custom event object presents a consistent view of the event
across all supported platforms and browsers, and provides many conveniences
not available even in a correct W3C implementation.

See the `DOM Custom Event Object Reference`_ for a detailed API description
of this object.

If you find that you're accessing the native event for any reason, create a
`new ticket`_ and we'll look into normalizing the behavior you're looking for.

.. _`Safari bug 7790`: http://bugzilla.opendarwin.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7790


Memory Usage
------------

Any object that has connected slots (via :mochiref:`connect()`) is referenced
by the Signal mechanism until it is disconnected via :mochiref:`disconnect()`
or :mochiref:`disconnectAll()`.

Signal does not leak. It registers an ``'onunload'`` event that disconnects all
objects on the page when the browser leaves the page. However, memory usage
will grow during the page view for every connection made until it is
disconnected. Even if the DOM object is removed from the document, it
will still be referenced by Signal until it is explicitly disconnected.

In order to conserve memory during the page view, :mochiref:`disconnectAll()`
any DOM elements that are about to be removed from the document.


Using Signal for non-DOM objects
--------------------------------

Signals are triggered with the :mochiref:`signal(src, 'signal', ...)`
function. Additional parameters passed to this are passed onto the
connected slots. Explicit signals are not required for DOM events.

Slots that are connected to a signal are called in the following manner
when that signal is signalled:

-   If the slot was a single function, then it is called with ``this`` set
    to the object originating the signal with whatever parameters it was
    signalled with.

-   If the slot was an object and a function, then it is called with
    ``this`` set to the object, and with whatever parameters it was
    signalled with.

-   If the slot was an object and a string, then ``object[string]`` is
    called with the parameters to the signal.


API Reference
=============


Signal API Reference
--------------------

:mochidef:`connect(src, signal, dest[, func])`:

    Connects a signal to a slot, and return a unique identifier that can be
    used to disconnect that signal.

    ``src`` is the object that has the signal. You may pass in a string, in
    which case, it is interpreted as an id for an HTML element.

    ``signal`` is a string that represents a signal name. If 'src' is an HTML
    Element, ``window``, or the ``document``, then it can be one of the
    'on-XYZ' events. You must include the 'on' prefix, and it must be all
    lower-case.

    ``dest`` and ``func`` describe the slot, or the action to take when the
    signal is triggered.

        -   If ``dest`` is an object and ``func`` is a string, then
            ``dest[func].apply(dest, ...)`` will be called when the signal
            is signalled.

        -   If ``dest`` is an object and ``func`` is a function, then
            ``func.apply(dest, ...)`` will be called when the signal is
            signalled.

        -   If ``func`` is undefined and ``dest`` is a function, then
            ``func.apply(src, ...)`` will be called when the signal is
            signalled.

    No other combinations are allowed and will raise an exception.

    The return value can be passed to :mochiref:`disconnect` to disconnect
    the signal.


:mochidef:`disconnect(ident)`:

    To disconnect a signal, pass its ident returned by :mochiref:`connect()`.
    This is similar to how the browser's ``setTimeout`` and ``clearTimeout``
    works.


:mochidef:`disconnectAll(src[, signal, ...])`:

    ``disconnectAll(src)`` removes all signals from src.
    
    ``disconnectAll(src, 'onmousedown', 'mySignal')`` will remove all
    ``'onmousedown'`` and ``'mySignal'`` signals from src.



:mochidef:`signal(src, signal, ...)`:

    This will signal a signal, passing whatever additional parameters on to
    the connected slots. ``src`` and ``signal`` are the same as for
    :mochiref:`connect()`.


DOM Custom Event Object Reference
---------------------------------

:mochidef:`event()`:

    The native event produced by the browser. You should not need to use this.


:mochidef:`src()`:

    The element that this signal is connected to.


:mochidef:`type()`:

    The event type (``'click'``, ``'mouseover'``, ``'keypress'``, etc.) as a
    string. Does not include the ``'on'`` prefix.


:mochidef:`target()`:

    The element that triggered the event. This may be a child of
    :mochiref:`src()`.


:mochidef:`modifier()`:

    Returns ``{shift, ctrl, meta, alt, any}``, where each property is ``true``
    if its respective modifier key was pressed, ``false`` otherwise. ``any``
    is ``true`` if any modifier is pressed, ``false`` otherwise.
    

:mochidef:`stopPropagation()`:

    Works like W3C's ``stopPropagation()``.
    

:mochidef:`preventDefault()`:

    Works like W3C's ``preventDefault()``.
    

:mochidef:`stop()`:

    Shortcut that calls ``stopPropagation()`` and ``preventDefault()``.


:mochidef:`key()`:

    Returns ``{code, string}``.
    
    Use ``'onkeydown'`` and ``'onkeyup'`` handlers to detect control
    characters such as ``'KEY_F1'``. Use the ``'onkeypressed'`` handler to
    detect "printable" characters, such as ``'Ã©'``.
    
    When a user presses F1, in ``'onkeydown'`` and ``'onkeyup'`` this method
    returns ``{code: 122, string: 'KEY_F1'}``. In ``'onkeypress'``, it returns
    ``{code: 0, string: ''}``.
    
    If a user presses Shift+2 on a US keyboard, this method returns
    ``{code: 50, string: 'KEY_2'}`` in ``'onkeydown'`` and ``'onkeyup'``.
    In ``'onkeypress'``, it returns ``{code: 64, string: '@'}``.
        
    See ``_specialKeys`` in the source code for a comprehensive list of
    control characters.


:mochidef:`mouse()`:

    Properties for ``'onmouse*'``, ``'onclick'``, ``'ondblclick'``, and
    ``'oncontextmenu'``:

        -   ``page`` is a :mochiref:`MochiKit.DOM.Coordinates` object that
            represents the cursor position relative to the HTML document. 
            Equivalent to ``pageX`` and ``pageY`` in Safari, Mozilla, and 
            Opera.

        -   ``client`` is a :mochiref:`MochiKit.DOM.Coordinates` object that
            represents the cursor position relative to the visible portion of 
            the HTML document. Equivalent to ``clientX`` and ``clientY`` on 
            all browsers.

    Properties for ``'onmouseup'``, ``'onmousedown'``, ``'onclick'``, and
    ``'ondblclick'``:

        -   ``mouse().button`` returns ``{left, right, middle}`` where each 
            property is ``true`` if the mouse button was pressed, ``false`` 
            otherwise.

    Known browser bugs:
    
        -   Current versions of Safari won't signal ``'ondblclick'`` when
            attached via ``connect()`` (`Safari Bug 7790`_).

        -   Mac browsers don't report right-click consistently. Firefox
            signals the slot and sets ``modifier().ctrl`` to true, Opera
            signals the slot and sets ``modifier().meta`` to ``true``, and
            Safari doesn't signal the slot at all (`Safari Bug 6595`_).
            
            To find a right-click in Safari, Firefox, and IE, you can connect
            an element to ``'oncontextmenu'``. This doesn't work in Opera.


:mochidef:`relatedTarget()`:

    Returns the document element that the mouse has moved to. This is
    generated for ``'onmouseover'`` and ``'onmouseout'`` events.
