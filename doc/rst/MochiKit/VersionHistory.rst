2005-07-29      v0.60

    - Beefed up the MochiKit.DOM test suite
    - Fixed return value for MochiKit.DOM.swapElementClass, could return
      false unexpectedly before
    - Added an optional "parent" argument to
      MochiKit.DOM.getElementsByTagAndClassName
    - Added a "packed" version in packed/MochiKit/MochiKit.js
    - Changed build script to rewrite the URLs in tests to account for the
      JSAN-required reorganization
    - MochiKit.Compat to potentially work around IE 5.5 issues
      (5.0 still not supported).  Test.Simple doesn't seem to work there,
      though.
    - Several minor documentation corrections
