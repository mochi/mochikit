**THIS FILE SHOULD BE IGNORED. IT IS INCLUDED FOR MY VSCODE SETUP WITH THE "TODO TREE" EXTENSION**.

TODO: make a lib.d.ts TypeScript definition file for compat with VSCode.
TODO: revamp the Base, which looks like a huge project.
TODO: revamp all submodules to import functions from the Base **NOT `import Base from './Base';** because that breaks tree-shaking.
TODO: start using Rollup and add npm tasks for it.
TODO: kill off all the python scripts and replace them with js ones.
TODO: cherry pick the best methods from older modules, maybe recreating them all.
TODO: add all DOM createElement shorthand elements like A, DIV, ARTICLE methods.
