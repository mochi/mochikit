SYNTAX: "TODO: {severity}"
TODO low: make a lib.d.ts TypeScript definition file for compat with VSCode.
TODO high: revamp the Base, which looks like a huge project.
TODO high: revamp all submodules to import functions from the Base **NOT `import Base from './Base';** because that breaks tree-shaking.
