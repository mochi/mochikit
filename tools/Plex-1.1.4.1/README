This is version 1.1.4 of Plex, a Python module for building lexical
analysers.  See the doc directory for instructions on using it.

Plex is free of any restrictions. You can use it, redistribute it,
sell it, whatever you want.  All I ask is that you give me credit if
you distribute any code derived from it.

Version History
---------------

1.1.4    Fixed bug causing argument of Rep or Rep1 to
         fail to match following a newline.

1.1.3    Fixed bug causing Eol to fail to match at the
         beginning of a line in some circumstances.

1.1.2    Changed Scanner.yield() to Scanner.produce() to
         accommodate Python 2.3, where yield is a keyword.

         Changed test10 to not rely so much on details of
         string repr.

1.1.1    Fixed two minor bugs: uncommented Scanner.next_char() and
         added import of types to Regexps.py.

1.1      Added support for case-insensitive matches.

1.0      First official release.
